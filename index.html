              <pre>
    OOP stands for object-oriented programming. 
    It is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions  to
    design applications and computer programs.  
     
  OOP has four main principles:
    o Inheritance
    o Polymorphism
    o Abstraction
    o Encapsulation

                <div class="content">
                  <p>C is a great option for those who want to learn systems-level programming. Once you get familiar with 
                    procedural programming in the C language, you can move on to learn the C++ programming language. If you 
                    are already familiar with OOPs concepts or have some knowledge of Java, you can easily learn C++, and it would
